## General Principles

### Core Values
- **Transparency**: All work should be visible and trackable
- **Collaboration**: Use GitLab features to work together effectively
- **Quality**: Maintain high code standards through reviews and testing
- **Documentation**: Keep clear records of decisions and changes
- **Security**: Protect sensitive information and follow security protocols

### Access Levels
- **Owner**: Full access to project settings (Team Lead/Manager)
- **Maintainer**: Can manage repository and merge to protected branches (Senior Developers)
- **Developer**: Can create branches and merge requests (Regular Developers)
- **Reporter**: Can view and comment on issues/MRs (QA, Product Managers)
- **Guest**: Limited view access (Stakeholders, Clients)

## Repository Structure

### Project Organization
```
project-root/
├── .gitlab/                    # GitLab templates and configuration
│   ├── issue_templates/
│   ├── merge_request_templates/
│   └── CODEOWNERS
├── docs/                       # Project documentation
├── src/                        # Source code
├── tests/                      # Test files
├── .gitlab-ci.yml             # CI/CD configuration
├── .gitignore                 # Git ignore rules
├── README.md                  # Project overview
└── CHANGELOG.md               # Version history
```

### Required Files
- **README.md**: Project description, setup instructions, and usage
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history and release notes
- **.gitignore**: Appropriate ignore rules for your technology stack
- **CODEOWNERS**: Define code ownership for automatic review assignments

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Types
- **main/master**: Production-ready code (protected)
- **develop**: Integration branch for features (protected)
- **feature/[feature-name]**: New features or enhancements
- **bugfix/[bug-description]**: Bug fixes
- **hotfix/[urgent-fix]**: Critical production fixes
- **release/[version]**: Release preparation

### Branch Naming Convention
```
feature/user-authentication
bugfix/login-error-handling
hotfix/security-vulnerability-fix
release/v2.1.0
```

### Branch Protection Rules
- **main/master**: Require merge requests, require CI/CD pipeline success
- **develop**: Require merge requests, allow maintainers to push
- No direct pushes to protected branches

### Workflow
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Work on feature with regular commits
3. Push branch and create merge request
4. Code review and CI/CD validation
5. Merge to `develop` after approval
6. Deploy to staging for testing
7. Merge `develop` to `main` for production release

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of what was changed and why.
Include any breaking changes or special instructions.

Closes #123
```

### Commit Types
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Examples
```bash
feat(auth): add user login functionality

Implement JWT-based authentication system with login/logout.
Includes password hashing and session management.

Closes #45

fix(api): resolve null pointer exception in user service

Add null checks before processing user data to prevent crashes
when user profile is incomplete.

Fixes #67
```

### Best Practices
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Reference issues using "Closes #123" or "Fixes #123"
- Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- Don't commit broken code

## Merge Request Process

### Creating Merge Requests

#### Required Information
- **Clear title**: Summarize the change
- **Description**: What was changed and why
- **Screenshots**: For UI changes
- **Testing instructions**: How to verify the changes

### Merge Request Rules
- Must have at least one approval from a maintainer

- Branch must be up to date with target branch
- All discussions must be resolved

### Draft Merge Requests
- Use "Draft:" prefix for work-in-progress

- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Use suggestion feature for small changes
- Mark discussions as resolved when addressed

### Response Expectations
- **High Priority**: 2 hours
- **Normal Priority**: 24 hours
- **Low Priority**: 3 business days

## Issue Management

### Issue Templates

#### Bug Report Template
```markdown

A clear description of what the bug is.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

## Expected Behavior

```

### Issue Labels
- **Priority**: `priority::high`, `priority::medium`, `priority::low`
- **Type**: `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `documentation`
- **Status**: `needs-investigation`, `in-progress`, `blocked`
- **Component**: `frontend`, `backend`, `database`, `ci/cd`

### Issue Assignment
- Assign to appropriate team member
- Set due dates for time-sensitive issues
- Use milestones for release planning
- Add weight estimates for effort tracking

## CI/CD Guidelines

### Pipeline Structure
```yaml
stages:
  - test
  - build
  - security
  - deploy-staging
  - deploy-production

variables:
  DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
  
before_script:
  - echo "Setting up environment..."

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - npm test
  coverage: '/Coverage: \d+\.\d+%/'
  
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building application..."
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/
    expire_in: 1 week
```

### Pipeline Best Practices
- Keep jobs fast (< 10 minutes)
- Use caching for dependencies
- Fail fast on critical errors
- Generate artifacts for deployments
- Include security scanning

### Environment Management
- **Development**: Auto-deploy from `develop` branch
- **Staging**: Auto-deploy from `develop`, manual promote to production
- **Production**: Manual deployment from `main` branch

### Secrets Management
- Use GitLab CI/CD variables for secrets
- Mark sensitive variables as "protected" and "masked"
- Use different secrets for different environments
- Never commit secrets to code

## Security Best Practices

### Code Security
- Never commit passwords, API keys, or secrets
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use dependency scanning in CI/CD
- Implement proper input validation

### Access Control
- Use SSH keys instead of passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Regularly review team access
- Remove access for former team members
- Use deploy keys for automated systems

### Repository Security
- Enable push rules to prevent secrets
- Use branch protection rules
- Require signed commits (optional)
- Enable security scanning features
- Regular security audit reviews

## Team Communication

### GitLab Integration
- Link GitLab with Slack/Teams for notifications
- Use @mentions for specific attention
- Reference issues/MRs in commits and comments
- Update issue status regularly

### Meeting Integration
- Create issues for action items from meetings
- Use milestones for sprint/iteration planning
- Document decisions in issue comments
- Link meeting notes to relevant issues

### Notification Settings
- Configure notifications to avoid spam
- Watch important repositories
- Set up custom notification rules
- Use labels to filter notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Merge Conflicts
```bash
# Update your branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout your-feature-branch
git merge develop

# Resolve conflicts in editor
# Add resolved files
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

#### Failed Pipeline
1. Check pipeline logs for error details
2. Run tests locally to reproduce
3. Fix issues and push new commit
4. Pipeline will automatically retry

#### Large File Issues
- Use Git LFS for large files
- Check .gitignore for unnecessary files
- Clean up repository history if needed

### Getting Help
1. Check this documentation first
2. Search existing issues for solutions
3. Ask in team Slack/Teams channel
4. Create issue for persistent problems
5. Contact team lead for urgent issues

## Enforcement

### Automated Checks
- Branch protection rules enforce review requirements
- CI/CD pipelines prevent broken code merges
- Security scans block vulnerable dependencies
- Lint checks maintain code quality

### Manual Review
- Weekly repository health checks
- Monthly access review
- Quarterly guideline updates
- Regular team training sessions
